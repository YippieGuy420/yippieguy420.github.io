	<h1>Hello there!</h1>
	<p>I'm not sure how you've stumbled onto this website, but I appreciate you being here. :D</p>
	<p>I'm not that good in building a website so this doesn't look good yet, but I'll try my best to make it readable at least!</p>
	<p>I want to add some stories when I have the time, but first gotta make this look cool.</p>
